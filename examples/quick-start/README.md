# Quick Start

This is the source code for the [Quick Start example on the UI2 Documentation](https://ui2-docs.vercel.app/quick-start/overview).

## Trying it Out

First, swap out the line that reads `apiKey: "API_KEY"` with your Cerebras API key.

> You can also use other providers compatible with Vercel AI SDK. Read [the documentation](https://ui2-docs.vercel.app/api-reference/createUI2#model) for more information.

Then, try running this code with:

```bash
node index.js
```
