# UI2 Spreadsheet

This is the source code for a UI2 Spreadsheet shown in the [UI2 Gallery](https://ui2-docs.vercel.app/gallery).

## Trying it Out

First, swap out the line that reads `apiKey: "API_KEY"` with your Cerebras API key in `app/components/Spreadsheet.tsx`.

> You can also use other providers compatible with Vercel AI SDK. Read [the documentation](https://ui2-docs.vercel.app/api-reference/createUI2#model) for more information.

Then, try running the website with:

```bash
npm run dev
```
