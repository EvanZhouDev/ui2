## Contributing vs Extending UI2

You have two options you can choose when it comes to developing UI2:

* Contributing to core UI2
* Extending UI2 for your own use

Let's discuss each one.

## Contributing to Core UI2

If you believe that there is a bug, a significant feature in UI2 missing, or something else, you should directly modify UI2 source code with a PR on GitHub.

## Extending UI2

However, if you believe the feature that you want implemented isn't something directly related to UI2 but rather an integration you want to add, Extending UI2 is your best option.

Typically these extensions do not need to be added to the core UI2 library. However, if you believe your extension is very important, such as the `StatefulIntentCreator` and the React hook, it is recommend that you add it to the UI2 repository. If you aren't sure, feel free to send a PR and have the reviewers figure it out.
