In text, UI2 should always be written as `UI2`, **not** `ui2`, `uii`, `UI Two`, and so on.

In code, this pattern should also be followed, although standard variable casing takes precedent. For example:

* If you have a function like `createUI2`, it should **not** be written `createUi2`
* If you have a function simply named `ui2()`, it should **not** be written `UI2()`
