## Origins of UI2

UI2 started as an abbreviation meaning the **User Intent Interface**. Alternatively, another abbreviation that was considered was **User Intent Identification**. However, as it evolved, and its ability to unify intents throughout an application was revealed, it later became the **Unified Intent Interface**.

Being abbreviated as "UII", the name **UI2** was eventually given meaning simultaneously the "Unified Intent Interface" and also the "next-generation UI."

## Branding Guidelines

In text, UI2 should always be written as `UI2`, **not** `ui2`, `uii`, `UI Two`, and so on.

In code, this pattern should also be ideally followed, although there are reasonable exceptions (such as the fact that standard naming conventions take precedent). For example:

| ✅ Do                               | ❌ Don't Do                                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A function written as `createUI2()` | `createUi2()` or `createui2()`                                    |
| A function written as `ui2()`       | `UI2()` (as capitalized first letter is reserved for class)       |
| A package name written as `ui2-sdk` | `UI2-sdk`, if your package manager prefers lowercase first letter |

- If you have a function like `createUI2`, it should **not** be written `createUi2`
- If you have a function simply named `ui2()`, it should **not** be written `UI2()`
