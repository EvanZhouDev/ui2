## Origins of UI2

UI2 started as an abbreviation meaning the **User Intent Interface**. Alternatively, another abbreviation that was considered was **User Intent Identification**. However, as it evolved, and its ability to unify intents throughout an application was revealed, it later became the **Unified Intent Interface**.

Being abbreviated as "UII", the name **UI2** was eventually given meaning simultaneously the "Unified Intent Interface" and also the "next-generation UI."

## Branding Guidelines

In text, UI2 should always be written as `UI2`, **not** `ui2`, `uii`, `UI Two`, and so on.

In code, this pattern should also be followed, although standard variable casing takes precedent. For example:

- If you have a function like `createUI2`, it should **not** be written `createUi2`
- If you have a function simply named `ui2()`, it should **not** be written `UI2()`
