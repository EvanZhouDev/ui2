UI2 is currently only available as a JavaScript/TypeScript library.

However, it's full of various features to help you identify intents for your app.

1. **Standalone Library**: You can use UI2 to directly identify intents. No UI or framework attached.
2. **Stateful Implementation**: You can use a Stateful version of UI2, built for frontend, to link to any input box with debounce and async processing built in
3. **React Hook**: Built on the Stateful Implementation, you can use the React hook to easily connect to your projects
