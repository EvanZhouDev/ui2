description: The central hook for creating your UI2 app
---

The useUI2 hook helps set up your UI2 application with "global" configuration options. It returns a few other variables for use throughout the app to control it's state.

useUI2 can be imported from

It should look something like this in the end:

```jsx
import { useUI2 } from "ui2.js";

let { inputValue, onInputChange, onSubmit } = useUI2({
	// config here...
});
```

First, we will talk about these return values, then, we will talk about the options you can pass to the hook.

## Return Values

`useUI2` returns the following properties, which can be deconstructed from the object:

| Value Name      | Description                                                                                              |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `isLoading`     | Boolean state representing whether or not Intent processing is happening                                 |
| `onInputChange` | What should be called when your UI2 input box changes. Triggers processing intents, among other things.. |
| `onSubmit`      | What should be called when the UI2 input box is submitted, triggering `onSubmit` on the current Intents. |
| `inputValue`    | Allows directly controlling value of the input box                                                       |
| `setInputValue` | Allows directly controlling value of the input box                                                       |

### Using Return Values

Now, you can use them in an input box and button as such. Note that you can add a Enter action to the input box as well to make it submit when the user presses Enter in the input box.

```jsx
<div className="flex flex-row gap-2">
	<input
		className="p-1 outline"
		value={inputValue}
		onChange={onInputChange}
		onKeyDown={(e) => {
			if (e.key === "Enter") {
				onSubmit();
			}
		}}
	/>
	<button className="p-1 outline" onClick={onSubmit}>
		Submit
	</button>
</div>
```

## Options

You can pass in an object to `useUI2` with the following properties:

| Value Name         | Type                                                                       | Description                                                                                                                                 |

### `model` Option

You have two choices when inputting a model. First, if you have a OpenAI-compatible model endpoint, you can use it as such:

```jsx
import { useUI2 } from "ui2.js";

let { inputValue, onInputChange, onSubmit } = useUI2({
	model: {
		baseURL: "YOUR_ENDPOINT",
		apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
		modelId: "YOUR_MODEL_NAME",
	},
});
```

The second, recommended option, is to use with the Vercel AI SDK. This allows you to use nearly any model that has integration with the SDK.

For example, with Cerebras, it could look like this:

```jsx
import { useUI2 } from "ui2.js";
import { createCerebras } from "@ai-sdk/cerebras";

const cerebras = createCerebras({
	apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
});

let { inputValue, onInputChange, onSubmit } = useUI2({
	model: cerebras("YOUR_MODEL_NAME"),
});
```

It is highly recommended to use Cerebras, since it offers a near-instant experience.

### `context` Option

The context option is a way to pass in any relevant state to the model. It must be "pass-by-reference" (in other words, an object) so that the model can see the changes to the state.

This means that if you have a non-object state, you will need to wrap it in a object for it to work. Here's an example:

```jsx
import { useUI2 } from "ui2.js";
import { useState } from "react";

const [name, setName] = useState("");

let { inputValue, onInputChange, onSubmit } = useUI2({
	// ... config here
	context: { myName: name },
});
```

### `onIntent` Option

The `onIntent` option is a function that is called when _any_ intent is detected. It can be used to trigger any side effects you want, such as updating state or making API calls.

The callback is passed one parameter, which is the `input` string, containing the text currently in the input box.

### `onSubmitStart` and `onSubmitComplete` Options

These work very similarly to the `onIntent` option, but are called when the submission process starts and completes, respectively.

The reason why there are two is due to the fact that submission may take time for the AI to load intents, given they are not processed yet. If you want some instant feedback, you can use `onSubmitStart`. If you want to do something after the submission is complete, you can use `onSubmitComplete`.

By default, `onSubmitStart` clears the input box. `onSubmitComplete` does nothing.
