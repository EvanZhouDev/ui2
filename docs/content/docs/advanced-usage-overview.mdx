description: What else can you do with UI2?
---

UI2 has many tricks up its sleeve. If you've just finished the Quick Start guides and don't want to go through the full documentation, here are a set of Advanced Examples to hopefully catch the features you want to use.

We'll go through most of the key features of UI2, including how to extend it for your own purposes.

Most of these will be based off the standard Stateless `createUI2`/`IntentCreator`, but since the Stateful API is a functional superset, you are able to apply all these features onto the React hook as well.
