Welcome to the UI2 API Documentation.

This documentation will guide you through not only the parameters for every single method and function available in UI2, but also _how it works_. By the end of this documentation, you'll also understand how to build your own integrations into UI2 and use intent nearly everywhere.

## The Structure of UI2

First, we have to have a quick overview of how UI2 works.

### The `IntentCreator` Class

At it's core, all UI2 implementations are based off the `IntentCreator` class.

This class helps manage all intents on your application, and also contains the logic to add intents and identify intents.

### The UI2 Builder Function

However, since it can be tedious to directly operate on a class ocassionally, UI2 is exposed to the user with a function builder interface.

For example, here's what it would look like with `IntentCreator`:

```ts
let ic = new IntentCreator();
ic.addIntent("intent1", {
	// config...
});
ic.addIntent("intent2", {
	// config...
});
ic.addIntent("intent3", {
	// config...
});
ic.identifyIntent("some intent");
```

But with the function builder syntax, it would look more like this:

```ts
let { identifyIntent } = createUI2()
    .addIntent("intent1", {
        // config...
    })
    .addIntent("intent2", {
        // config...
    })
    .addIntent("intent3", {
        // config...
    })

identifyIntent("some intent");
```

As you can see, you no longer need to have a reference to IntentCreator, but can rather build continuously on one function.

### Extending UI2

But due to how `IntentCreator` is also available directly from the API, UI2 can easily be extended.

That is, you can extend the `IntentCreator` class to integrate extra capabilities, and even create new Builder Functions to use.

For example, the React hook uses a custom `StatefulIntentCreator` which is uses this pattern.

## Documentation Structure

We'll first go through the `IntentCreator` class, and how it works.

Then, we'll discuss `createUI2` and it's methods.

Finally, we will talk more about how to use the core extensions of `StatefulIntentCreator` and the React Hook.
