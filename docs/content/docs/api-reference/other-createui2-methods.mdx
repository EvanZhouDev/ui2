title: Other createUI2 Methods
description: Documentation for the rest of the createUI2 methods
---

Besides the main methods like [`addIntent`](/api-reference/addIntent), [`addOther`](/api-reference/addOther), and [`identifyIntent`](/api-reference/identifyIntent), documented before, there are also other methods available on `IntentCreator` (returned by `createUI2`). They are documentd here.

## `setContext`

```ts
public setContext(context: object): this
```

This method takes one argument, and helps to "rebind" the context to any new object.

This is because if you originally pass in an object to the configuration, it will only update if you update the reference to that object.

If you wish to change the object reference or put a new object altogether, this will help.

## `removeIntent`

```ts
public removeIntent(intentName: string): this
```

This method removes an intent from the UI2 Interface. It takes the `intentName`, and will throw an error if the Intent is not defined.

This can be helpful to modify the UI2 intent interface dynamically.
