title: addOther
description: Using the catch-all Other intent
---

The `other` intent is unique. It acts as a catch-all intent for cases where no other intent can be matched.

This intent is rarely called, but you can instruct the AI to do so more commonly or less commonly in the description of this method.

Furthermore, the `onIntent` and `onCleanup` cycle is slightly different for the `other` intent.

Most importantly, know that `onCleanup` is only called when there is any `other` intent identified and later removed.

This means that even if the content is different and there is an `other` intent in `currentIntents`, it is possible no cleanup and re-trigger is called.

Besides that, `addOther` functions very similarly to `addIntent` with a few "missing" parameters that you cannot customize on `other`.

## `addOther` Parameters

| `onIntent`    | `(intentCall: IntentCall<T>, input?: string) => void` | Called when this intent is identified.           |
| `onCleanup`   | `(intentCall: IntentCall<T>, input?: string) => void`                    | Called when this intent is no longer detected.   |
