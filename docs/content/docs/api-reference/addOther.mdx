title: addOther
description: Using the catch-all Other intent
---

The `other` intent is unique. It acts as a catch-all intent for cases where no other intent can be matched.

<Callout type="warn">
	You cannot name a normal intent `"other"`. If you wish to manipulate
	properties on the `other` intent, you must use the `addOther` method.
</Callout>

This intent is rarely called, but you can instruct the AI to do so more commonly or less commonly in the description of this method.

## The `other` Intent Lifecycle

Furthermore, the lifecycle of `other` is slightly different than normal intents. Specifically, because the `other` intent does not have any parameters, the following will occur `onIntent` only occurs when the intents identified goes from anything that is _not `other`_ to _`other`_. In other words, even if the content of the input changes, and it was `other` before and after, `onIntent` will not be called again.

## `addOther` Parameters

When dealing with the call signature, `addOther` functions very similarly to `addIntent` with a few "missing" parameters that you cannot customize on `other`.

Of course, you cannot customize the name. The configuration is also missing a few properties.

| Value Name    | Type                                                  | Description                                      |
| :------------ | :---------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `description` | `string`                                              | Customize when the `other` intent can be called. |
| `onIntent`    | `(intentCall: IntentCall<T>, input?: string) => void` | Called when this intent is identified.           |
| `onCleanup`   | `(intentCall: IntentCall<T>, input?: string) => void` | Called when this intent is no longer detected.   |

Consult the `addIntent` documentation to learn more about what these do.
