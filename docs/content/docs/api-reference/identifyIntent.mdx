description: Triggering intent identification
---

`identifyIntent` is the main function used to trigger intent identification.

## `identifyIntent` Parameters

```ts
async identifyIntent(text: string, config?: IdentifyIntentConfig): void
```

This takes two parameters: The current `text` to identify as well as an optional configuration object.

- `text`: A string for the "input" to intent identification
- `config`: Takes one property, which is the `currentIntents`, an array of `IntentCalls[]`.

## `identifyIntent` Return Value

There are multiple ways to process intents already:

- Use the `onIntent` and `onCleanup` event listeners on `addIntent` (Recommended)
- You can also use the `onInten` and `onCleanup` event listeners on `createUI2` itself

The final way to do it is to use `identifyIntent`'s return value, which is a list of `IntentCalls[]`.

## Using `currentIntents`

Without knowing what intents are "currently active," there is no way to know what to clean up.

<Callout type="warn">
	Without passing any `currentIntents` with the Stateless UI2 API, there will
	never be any `onCleanup` called.
</Callout>

The `currentIntents` list should tell UI2 what intents are currently active (typically as the output of a previous `identifyIntent` call), before the current `identifyIntent` was even called.

Then, if there are any changes from the initial list, further `onIntent` and `onCleanup` can be called.

## Summary

This is more so an internal API, so wrappers like `StatefulIntentCreator` don't require this anymore, and instead have other "entrypoints" such as state updates.
