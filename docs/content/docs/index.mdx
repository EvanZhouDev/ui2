## The Problem

The idea of the User Interface has always been the same since it's creation.

1. You have an **intention** to do something
2. You formulate how to **translate** that Intention into Actions
3. You take those **actions** on the UI to achieve your goal

But imagine a world where there is no barrier between **intention** and **action**. One where you can directly express your **Intent**—and have the computer handle the rest for you.

That very _idea_ is UI2.

## What is UI2?

UI2, or the **Unified Intent Interface** is a framework for a natural-language interface to any application.

It is powered by the idea of **Intent Identification**, merging all the intents in your app—searching, taking action, and more—into a single natural language interface.

UI2 can be described with three core ideas:

1. **Unification**: Search, taking action, and everything else you can do on an application should not be separate interfaces, but rather unified into one.
2. **Intent Detection**: The key point in combining these interfaces is identifying the user intent, now possible through LLMs
3. **Instant Preview**: Imagine autocomplete for _actions_—not just words, in which you can "preview-before-committing." [Learn more](#instant-preview-ui2-vs-chatbot) about this key principle of UI2.

## Instant Preview: UI2 vs Chatbot

The idea of converting natural language into action is something existing chatbots can already do. But UI2 hopes to take this a step further by addressing a key issue with existing implementations: **Uncertainty**.

Possibly the most important principle of UI2 is **Instant Preview**: You can see the intents detected as you type.

Unlike a chatbot with which you are not sure about what it could do, UI2 gives you the constant feedback of standard UI while achieving the fluidity of the natural language interface.

## Building with UI2

Intent identification is undoubtedly the future of the User Interface.

But the most important part is what you can build with it. So, let's get right into it.
