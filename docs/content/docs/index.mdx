## What is UI2?

UI2, or the **Unified Intent Interface** is a framework for a natural-language interface to any application. It merges all the intents in your app—from searching, taking action, and more—into a single text interface with live preview of your actions, so you can see exactly what you are doing before you even press submit.

## Philosophy

1. **Unification**: Search, taking action, and everything else you can do on an application should not be separate interfaces, but rather unified into one.
2. **Intent Detection**: The key point in combining these interfaces is identifying the user intent, now possible through LLMs
3. **Instant Preview**: UI2 enables the idea of instant intent detection. Imagine autocomplete for _actions_—not just words, in which you can "preview-before-committing"
