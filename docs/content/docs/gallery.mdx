description: What has been built with UI2
---

Here is a list of various applications that have been built in UI2â€”some for demonstration purposes, some for practical use.

This is a great source of inspiration for what UI2 can be used to build. Feel free to add your own use case to this by contributing to the docs [on GitHub](https://github.com/evanzhoudev/ui2).

## Todo List/Reminders App

This app helps you keep track of reminders or todos, with due dates, priority levels, and more. It uses UI2 to help the user quickly create, modify, and remove reminders.

The [source code](https://github.com/EvanZhouDev/ui2/tree/main/examples/todo-list) is available in the examples folder of the UI2 repository.

## Photo Editor

This app helps you edit photos. It's a perfect example of merging a normal photo editor with UI2, so you can choose to edit with the slides, or with natural language. It uses UI2 to apply filters, change settings, and more.

The [source code](https://github.com/EvanZhouDev/ui2/tree/main/examples/photo-editor) is available in the examples folder of the UI2 repository.
