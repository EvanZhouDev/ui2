title: Setting Up UI2
description: Set up everything you need to use UI2
---

Let's start by installing UI2, available on NPM or your favorite package manager.

```bash tab="NPM"
npm i ui2-sdk
```

```bash tab="PNPM"
pnpm add ui2-sdk
```

```bash tab="Bun"
bun add ui2-sdk
```

```bash tab="Yarn"
yarn add ui2-sdk
```

For this guide, we can use either TypeScript or JavaScript. Howevever, UI2 is built from the ground up for TS, so feel free to try it out!

Now, simply import `createUI2`, and call it for now. This is how we'll be building our UI2 app today.

```ts
import { createUI2 } from "ui2-sdk";

let { identifyIntent } = createUI2({});
```

We'll discuss the `identifyIntent` more later. However, for now, just know this is how you'll be actually identifying intent from text.

Next, in the configuration object, we need to put a `model`. These are available through the Vercel AI SDK.

It is highly recommended that you use the [Cerebras](https://www.cerebras.ai/)
models for their speed. Learn how to set it up on the [Vercel AI SDK
Website](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/ai-sdk-providers/cerebras).

<Callout type="warn" title="Structured Output">
	UI2 uses Structured Output to guarentee that your Intent parameter schemas are
	satisfied. Your model has to support this feature. `llama-3.3-70b` from
	Cerebras works great.
</Callout>

After you have your model set up, it should look something like this:

```ts
import { createUI2 } from "ui2-sdk";
import { createCerebras } from "@ai-sdk/cerebras";

const cerebras = createCerebras({
	apiKey: "API_KEY",
});

let { identifyIntent } = createUI2({
	model: cerebras("llama-3.3-70b"),
});
```

In order to run your app, you can either compile it if you're using TypeScript, or simply run it with Node.js if you're using JS:

```bash
node yourCode.js
```

Now, let's move on to creating some intents!
