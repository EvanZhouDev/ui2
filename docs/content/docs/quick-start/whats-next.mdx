Our UI2 app is now up and running, but it is extremely basic and unstyled—UI2 is designed to be headless, so it's super easy to customize the UI to your liking.

It also only has a few basic features. You can build a lot more on just that todo app, including adding more intents, but there's so many more possibilities with UI2.

Here are some examples use cases for UI2:

- **Spreadsheet/Database Visualizer**: UI2 can enable live-time querying of databases/spreadsheets, allowing you to preview actions such as "Remove all inactive users" or "Merge duplicate customer records" before actually committing to them.
- **Calendar App**: UI2 can visualize calendar changes and edits live—so you can see exactly what you're doing before you actually commit to a change.
- **Project Management Tool**: UI2 can enable live-time project management, allowing you to preview actions such as "Add a new task" or "Assign a task to a user"
- **And so much more!** We're excited to see what you do with UI2.
