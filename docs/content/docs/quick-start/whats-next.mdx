Congratulations on identifying your first intent with UI2.

The Quick Start that you just learned helped guide you through the concepts of UI2. Now, you can start building your first apps.

## Continuing with UI2

The great thing is that UI2 has built-in integrations with React that allows you to build a powerful UI2 intent-based application easily.

The UI2 API is also heavily extensible. If you wish to develop deeper Intent-based integrations, feel free to read the API reference for UI2.
