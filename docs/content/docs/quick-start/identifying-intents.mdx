title: Identifying Intents
description: Identifying your first intent

Now that you've defined the intents, it's time to actually try to identify intents from text.

In order to do this, we'll be using that `identifyIntent` function that we destructured from `createUI2`.

Here's the code:

```ts
identifyIntent("what is 2+2");
```

## It's as Simple as That

That's it. You don't need to assign it to a variable, write any if statements to process, or anything.

Seems too good to be true?

Well, sort of. In fact, in your `createUI2` above, you already defined all the behavior. Thus, `identifyIntent` directly draws from that. No additional setup needed.

## The Complete Code

To conclude, here's the final code all over again:

```ts
import { createUI2 } from "ui2-kit";
import { cerebras } from "@ai-sdk/cerebras";
import { z } from "zod";

let { identifyIntent } = createUI2({
	model: cerebras("llama-3.3-70b"),
})
	.addIntent("sum", {
		parameters: z.object({
			a: z.number(),
			b: z.number(),
		}),
		description: "Add two numbers together",
		onIntent: (intentCall) => {
			console.log(
				`${intentCall.parameters.a} + ${intentCall.parameters.b} = ${
					intentCall.parameters.a + intentCall.parameters.b
				}`
			);
		},
	})
	.addIntent("square", {
		parameters: z.object({
			a: z.number(),
		}),
		description: "Squares a number",
		onIntent: (intentCall) => {
			console.log(
				`${intentCall.parameters.a}^2 = ${
					intentCall.parameters.a * intentCall.parameters.a
				}`
			);
		},
	});

identifyIntent("what is 2+2");
```
