title: Using Intent Call IDs

Each Intent Call comes with an ID that is kept throughout it's lifecycle.

## Why is the ID needed?

Using IDs means that you can use it to reference something throughout the `onIntent`, `onCleanup`, or even `onSubmit` (with the React hook) of an intent.

Furthermore, it allows you to keep track of intents with the exact same name and parameters.

## How IDs are Assigned

IDs are simply created with `crypto.randomUUID()`.

A new ID is only created when a new Intent has different parameters, or there is more intents with the same parameters identified than currently. (i.e. a new ID is only created when `onIntent` is called).

It is highly recommended to associate previews of Intents with IDs, so they can later be confirmed with `onSubmit` if applicable.

## Usage Example

Read the [React Quick Start](/react-quick-start/overview) for an example of how to use these IDs to keep track of various todos.

Intent Call IDs are also available on the Stateless API, but it doesn't really make sense to use them, unless you pass in `currentIntents` for the `identifyIntent` function.
