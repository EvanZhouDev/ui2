The basic structure of UI2 takes the following form:

* A "core" `IntentCreator` class that controls creating and identifying intents
* A "builder function" `createUI2` that wraps that class

However, as the existence of the `StatefulIntentCreator` shows, the basic "core" UI2 is very limited and also can be extended.

In order to extend UI2, you need to do two things:

## Extend `IntentCreator`

Recall that the class interface is mostly "internal" and will not directly be used by the user. As such, it is better to make this class extremely general.

Nonetheless, it should handle any state, any functions, and more that your intent identification needs.

As an example, consult the `StatefulIntentCreator` Documentation

## Build a Wrapper Function

Now, you need to build a wrapper function to go around your class to make it easier to use. The most basic version of a wrapper function would be to literally return your new `IntentCreator` extension.

However, there could be more to it than just that.

For example, the React hook helps create and bind state, as well as use `useEffect` to bind context to make sure it's updated.

## `IntentCreator` Extension vs Wrapper Function

Remember that your `IntentCreator` may be used for more than just your specific Wrapper Function.

Thus, make your `IntentCreator` more general and use your Wrapper Function to make it more specific.
