title: Catch-all/Other Intent
description: Learn how to use the catch-all Other intent and its special features
---

The `other` intent is unique. It acts as a catch-all intent for cases where no other intent can be matched.

<Callout type="warn">
You cannot name a normal intent `"other"`. If you wish to manipulate properties on the `other` intent, you must use the `addOther` method.
</Callout>

Using the `other` intent could look something like this:

```ts
import { createUI2 } from "ui2-kit";
import { cerebras } from "@ai-sdk/cerebras";
import { z } from "zod";

let { identifyIntent } = createUI2({
	model: cerebras("llama-3.3-70b"),
})
	.addIntent("sum", {
		parameters: z.object({
			a: z.number(),
			b: z.number(),
		}),
		description: "Add two numbers together",
		onIntent: (intentCall) => {
			console.log(
				`${intentCall.parameters.a} + ${intentCall.parameters.b} = ${
					intentCall.parameters.a + intentCall.parameters.b
				}`
			);
		},
	})
	.addOther({
		description: "Use this for any other mathematical operation",
        onIntent: (intentCall) => console.log("That operation has no intent!")
	});

identifyIntent("what is log base 2 of 4?");
```

This intent is rarely called, but you can instruct the AI to do so more commonly or less commonly in the description of this method.

## The `other` Intent Lifecycle

Furthermore, the `onIntent` and `onCleanup` cycle is slightly different for the `other` intent.

Most importantly, know that `onCleanup` is only called when there is any `other` intent identified and later removed.

This means that even if the content is different and there is an `other` intent in `currentIntents`, it is possible no cleanup and re-trigger is called.

## Parameters

Besides that, `addOther` functions very similarly to `addIntent` with a few "missing" parameters that you cannot customize on `other`.

For one, you cannot pass in a name.

Furthermore, in the configuration, you can only pass in:

* `description`
* `onIntent`
* `onCleanup`
* `onSubmit` (with React hook)

The signature of these functions are identical.

## Recommended Use Case

It is highly recommended that for complicated applications, that you connect some form of a Chatbot/Agent onto UI2 when the `other` intent is submitted.

This way, the user can express complicated workflows in the UI2 input and have them ran.
