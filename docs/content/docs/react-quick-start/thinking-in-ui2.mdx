title: Thinking in UI2
description: Learn how the UI2 API is structured.

UI2 is built around "intents," which can be thought of as **possible user actions**. As UI2 developers, you are responsible for defining these intents and their associated actionsâ€”as well as the UI on which these actions take place. The UI2 API will handle the rest, including prompting the AI, parsing output, and more.

## The Structure of an Intent

Each intent has a **name**, an optional **description**, as well as a list of **parameters**.

Furthermore, each **intent** has 3 main "lifecycle" events:

- `onIntent`: A function that is called when the intent is identified
- `onCleanup`: A cleanup function that is called when the intent is no longer relevant
- `onSubmit`: A function that is called when the user submits the textbox with the intent

This lifecycle, especially `onCleanup`, may seem confusing. So, let's look at an example of how it could work for our todo app.

## Choosing Our Intents

For our app, we can identify the following intents and what should happen in their lifecycle.

- `addTodo`
  - **Parameters**: Name of the todo
  - `onIntent`: Show a preview of the new todo, to be added
  - `onCleanup`: Remove the preview
  - `onSubmit`: Actually add the new todo to the list
- `completeTodo`
  - **Parameters**: Which todo to mark as complete
  - `onIntent`: Show a preview of the todo to be marked as complete
  - `onCleanup`: Remove the preview
  - `onSubmit`: Actually mark the todo as complete

As you can see, all of these intents have a very similar lifecycle. As such, UI2 is designed to be compatible with a wide variety of different applications.

If it's helpful, in general for UI2, the lifecycle should look like this:

- `onIntent`: Typically the first event listener called, when the intent is detected
  - This event listener is responsible for showing a preview of the user's Intent, translated to Action
- `onCleanup`: Possibly called after `onIntent`, after the intent is no longer detected
  - This event listener is responsible for removing that preview of the user's Intent to "clean up" any side-effects
- `onSubmit`: Called when the user "submits" the intent by confirming. Cleanup is _not_ called when submitted
  - This event listener is responsible for "confirming" the preview.

To make this even more concrete, let's see how we can actually implement this in our app.
