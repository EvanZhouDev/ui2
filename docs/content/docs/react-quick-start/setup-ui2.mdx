title: Setting Up UI2
description: Set up everything you need to use UI2
---

Let's start by creating a state for all our todos, and a simple UI to render all our todos as well as the UI2 input box and submit button.

Update your `page.tsx` with a few changes:

```jsx
"use client";
import { useUI2 } from "ui2-kit";
import { useState } from "react";

export default function Page() {
	const [todos, setTodos] = useState<
		{
			id: string;
			name: string;
			completed: boolean;
            preview: string;
		}[]
	>([]);

	return (
		<div className="w-screen h-screen flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-4">
			{todos.length
				? todos.map((x) => (
						<div key={x.id} className={x.preview ? "opacity-50" : ""}>
							{x.name} - {x.completed ? "Completed" : "Todo"}
						</div>
				  ))
				: "No todos"}
			<div className="flex flex-row gap-2">
				<input className="p-1 outline" />
				<button className="p-1 outline">Submit</button>
			</div>
		</div>
	);
}
```

We're also including a `preview` field and UI state to each reminder. It'll make more sense when we start making intents and previewing intent actions.

Now, we'll set up UI2. We will use the `useUI2` hook, which returns state variables and functions to manage the UI2 state. The Here's what it should look like:

```jsx
let { inputValue, onInputChange, onSubmit } = useUI2({
	// config here...
});
```

Let's update our input and submit button to use these returned variables:

```jsx
<div className="flex flex-row gap-2">
	<input className="p-1 outline" value={inputValue} onChange={onInputChange} />
	<button className="p-1 outline" onClick={onSubmit}>
		Submit
	</button>
</div>
```

Next, in the configuration object for `useUI2`, we need to put a `model`. These are available through the Vercel AI SDK.

It is highly recommended that you use the [Cerebras](https://www.cerebras.ai/) models for their speed. Learn how to set it up on the [Vercel AI SDK Website](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/ai-sdk-providers/cerebras). However, you can choose any provider you want.

After you have your model set up, it should look something like this:

```jsx
import { cerebras } from "@ai-sdk/cerebras";

let { inputValue, onInputChange, onSubmit } = useUI2({
	model: cerebras("llama-3.3-70b"),
});
```

Let's also provide a System Prompt to tell the model what app we're making:

```jsx
let { inputValue, onInputChange, onSubmit } = useUI2({
	model: cerebras("llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct"),
	systemPrompt: "This is a todo app.",
});
```

Finally, we have to give the model access to our reminders. We can use the `context` field to pass in any relevant state object.

```jsx
let { inputValue, onInputChange, onSubmit } = useUI2({
	model: cerebras("llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct"),
	systemPrompt: "This is a todo app.",
	context: todos,
});
```

Context is an interesting part of UI2, as not only is intent detection now based off just the single text you are typing in, it's also based on everything in your app.

Altogether, your file should look like this now:

```jsx
"use client";
import { useUI2 } from "ui2-kit";
import { cerebras } from "@ai-sdk/cerebras";
import { useState } from "react";

export default function Page() {
	const [todos, setTodos] = useState<
		{
			id: string;
			name: string;
			completed: boolean;
            status: boolean;
		}[]
	>([]);

	let { inputValue, onInputChange, onSubmit } = useUI2({
		model: cerebras("llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct"),
		systemPrompt: "This is a todo app.",
		context: todos,
	});

	return (
		<div className="w-screen h-screen flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-4">
			{todos.length
				? todos.map((x) => (
						<div key={x.id} className={x.preview ? "opacity-50" : ""}>
							{x.name} - {x.completed ? "Completed" : "Todo"}
						</div>
				  ))
				: "No todos"}
			<div className="flex flex-row gap-2">
				<input
					className="p-1 outline"
					value={inputValue}
					onChange={onInputChange}
				/>
				<button className="p-1 outline" onClick={onSubmit}>
					Submit
				</button>
			</div>
		</div>
	);
}
```
