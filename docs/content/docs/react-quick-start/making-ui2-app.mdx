import { Step, Steps } from "fumadocs-ui/components/steps";

Let's start by making our first UI2 application.
As a reminder, we'll be making a **simple todo app** powered by UI2, with the following features integrated in the Intent Interface:

- **Add todos**
- **Mark todos as complete**

Let's start by setting up our project. We'll be using Next.js as our template.

<Steps>
<Step>
 
### Create a Next.js App

```sh
npx create-next-app@latest
```

Walk through the app creation steps.

<Callout title="TypeScript Support">
	UI2 is written in TypeScript and has many amazing features only available in
	TypeScript.
</Callout>

We'll be using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

</Step>
 
<Step>
 
### Install UI2

Use `npm`, or your favorite package manager.

```sh
npm i ui2-sdk
```

</Step>

<Step>
 
### Prepare the Files

Put the following code in your `page.tsx`:

```jsx
"use client";
import { useUI2 } from "ui2-sdk/react";

export default function Page() {
	return (
		<div>
			<h1>Hello UI2!</h1>
		</div>
	);
}
```

<Callout>
	Note how we are importing the `useUI2` hook from `ui2-sdk/react` instead of
	just `ui2-sdk`. This helps organize the features of UI2.
