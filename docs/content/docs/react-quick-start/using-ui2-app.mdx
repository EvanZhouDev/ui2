title: Using Your UI2 App
description: The features to try
---

Now that you've finished your app, you can actually try using it.

The great part about UI2 is that due to the powerful LLM powered intent framework, there is much more to UI2 than what's exposed on the surface.

Here are some basic things to try out:

- Create a reminder with a natural language statement
- Complete reminders with natural language statements

And some more complicated things that you can do:

- Create multiple reminders with natural language statements
- Complete all your reminders
- Combination of creating and completing reminders

## Notes on AI Usage

There are a few things that you have to be aware of while using UI2. While UI2 does not use that many tokens per request, it does tend to use many requests.

While typically its hard to hit rate limits when you are the one using UI2, you may hit rate limits during development.

Something that you can change is the `debounceDelay` which increases the cooldown between consecutive AI calls. Similarly, if you ahve the budget, you can also decrease this delay to make UI2 feel more snappy.

It's best to adapt this delay to your audience. For example:

- **Shorter Delay**: If your app requires very fast feedback or typically consists of fast typers
- **Longer Delay**: If immediate preview isn't as important or your app typically has slower typers

You can change this property by passing it into the `useUI2` config, as such:

```ts
let { inputValue, onInputChange, onSubmit } = useUI2({
	model: cerebras("llama-3.3-70b"),
	systemPrompt: "This is a todo app.",
	debounceDelay: 500, // In ms
	context: todos,
});
```

Note that the default delay is 300ms.

Note that this delay has to be combined with AI latency, so the real debounce will _feel_ like more than 300ms.
